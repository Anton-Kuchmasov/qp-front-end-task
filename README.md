# MetaTrader4 Landing Page
In this project I implemented a pixel-perfect responsive Landing Page for Traders

Technologies I used here: 
- HTML;
- CSS;
- SCSS;
- JavaScript;
- React.js.

Obioviosly, you can easily add or change any data in my application.
You can use raw array, API or even JSON to add some info (user reviews, step-by-step info for new users etc.)
Made sincerly by heart :)
